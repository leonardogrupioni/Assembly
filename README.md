# 🧠 Assembly – MIPS Practice

This repository contains exercises written in MIPS Assembly, developed as part of my studies in **Computer Architecture** and **Low-Level Programming** at PUC-SP.

The goal of these activities is to better understand how a computer executes instructions at the hardware level, focusing on register manipulation, memory addressing, and control flow using Assembly language.

## 🎯 Topics Covered

- Register usage and conventions
- Arithmetic and logic operations
- Conditional branches and loops
- Memory access (`lw`, `sw`, etc.)
- Function calls and stack usage
- String manipulation and syscall interaction

## ⚙️ Technologies

- Language: MIPS Assembly
- Tools: [MARS-MIPS](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm) 
- Platform: Cross-platform (Java-based tools)

## 🧪 How to Run

Open `.asm` files using [MARS-MIPS](https://computerscience.missouristate.edu/mars-mips-simulator.htm):

1. Load the desired file.
2. Assemble the code.
3. Run or step through the program to observe behavior.
